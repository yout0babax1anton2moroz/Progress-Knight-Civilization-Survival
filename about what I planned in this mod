About the mod
if briefly the mod is about how you playing for a country defend yourself from hordes of monsters that come periodically every 10 years and grow in strength over time until a reset or until after 70 years of survival the country opens an amulet that is urgently reset as in a normal progress king, for a reset the population of the country must fall below 2 people. mechanics that I planned to add
mechanics of technologies in civilizations for example farming knowledge LOG(n)/4=t^y
n=eta total amount of knowledge generated by scientists about people setting to work in the area in this case farming is considered
t=eta amount of bonuses that knowledge gives y=eta level of technologies (technology level rises as in normal progress king) (bonus from knowledge eta logarithm of total experience)
basic strength of intelligent life forms of their varieties by life forms less than which it cannot beat it is possible and will appear in normal energy
1 - normal
50 strength - magical (0.0001%)
2000 strength - heroic (0.000000001%
1000000 strength - deities (0.000000000000000001%
20 billion sili- cosmic force of type 1 (1 e^40%)(percentage of how many of them will there be in percentage terms in the population of the country if it is below one then it does not exist)
reinforcements when moving to a new level of life form buff to strength in the degree
1.05
1.10
1.20
1.40
2.0
mechanics of advancement from one form to another life form
a person should have 2 times more power than the basic powers of the level of life forms to which he was going to move (this requirement can be reduced by techniques and the method takes into account only the basic ones from the start of the game)
the method when moving to a new level of life form a person's training efficiency will increase and will be 100^(x) less than one will not be where x is the number of life forms (2- magic, 3-heroic, 4-divine, 5-cosmic) more effective than a person's average
the basic power of monsters and life forms at which the energy class is higher than usual or higher than 1 degree)
5 for monsters
500 for magical life forms
200000 for demonic life forms
10 billion for divine life forms
and 1e16 power for space life forms
hunting
hunters give 30 units of food for each killed monster about life forms hunting
well everything is simple here
not only does it give the strength of troops
but also meat that can be digested into food
but in hunting there will be a risk of losing all hunters if they are not strong enough
they will hunt monsters and living life forms from the number they will depend on the type of hunting to fight monsters from 50% to 120% of the number of troops (1 type mass hunting) sent to hunt and from the points not dropped also from 50%-120% of the number (2 types single hordes to catch) and with the help the strength of monsters will vary from the number of points not dropped from 50% to 120% (the standard coefficient of average monster strength is 1 in waves for every 10 years)
with the help of meat monsters when the population eats they can increase basic training of a person
but slowly by 0.001 per day but at the same time it also falls with the increase of the average strength of the population of civilizations
like if one year of such meat of an insect eats then already a person has +0.25 basic training
and if the average strength of the population is 1.25
effectiveness of the increase in strength is also 25% lower and eta is 0.00075 per day
training
the training mode trains troops depending on the training technologies (1.02^x where x is the eta level) and at the same time the average strength of the troops is trained and it will fall the more troops you have for example (the basic strength of the troops is 1 per person when hiring) you have a strength of 10 troops per 1 person in your number of soldiers 1k as a result the total strength of the troops is 10k, and if you increase the troops to 10k then the total strength of the troops will be only 19k and the average strength of a soldier will be only 1.9 of a person
and regarding training, the higher the average strength of troops, the less the effect of training to almost complete stop
for example, your troop strength is 1
the basic training efficiency is 0.05 per day
and if a person already has a strength of 1.5
then the training efficiency will be one and a half times lower
that is, 0.03 per day
life expectancy of the population in the country
it will increase and due to knowledge in medicine and due to the average strength of the population (the general strength coefficient to the power of 0.2)
for example, the average strength of troops is 50, then people in the troops will live 2 times longer than the average resident without training
and if 1.25, then only 4% longer
and yes, when people stop eating monster meat
their average strength does not decrease
hp
so the armies will have hp
hp will be each soldier in the army
hp will increase with the level of training research on 1.05, research on gene development, research on energy control for body strengthening, research on medicine
reception hp will increase from strength
100k1
like 1 human strength = 100 hp
hp of an individual will diverge like this in battles
if 1000 to 1000 it is to 1 to 1
then 1 soldier receives damage as from 1 monster
and if 10000 to 1000
then it is 10k 1
1 soldier receives damage of 0.1 monster attacks
and if 1000 to 100000 (a very common occurrence in the game will be in the later stages)
1 soldier receives damage of 100 average monster strengths
